This is just a play around for packaging, documenting and QAing PHP projects using [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) and [Sonar](http://www.sonarsource.org/)

build.xml is based off [Jenkins-PHP](http://jenkins-php.org/) - however I was running into trouble with PHPUnit which is why it's commented out for the time being.

I might look at adding additional javascript and Flash based build, document and QA stuff into the build.
